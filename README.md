# Bunce

    Home is safe.
    Home is a place to return to. To reset.
    Through our existence we build our home.
    It serves as a launching point for grander and grander adventures.
    But we can always return to Home. To reset.
    Home is safe.

Thank you to Godot for giving us a Linux-supporting, open-source game engine that is both very high quality and very quick to learn!
